        <h2>Writing With And For Digital Media</h2>
        <p>In this final project, I reflect on each of my projects and develop a narrative about what I have learned about data and information.</p>

            <h2>The Dataviz Project</h2>
            <p>My first project involved collecting, organizing and creating a set of data in Google Sheets for 7 days about one of my everyday digital habits. Specifically, I tracked the type of playlist I listened to on Spotify. The three families of playlists I tracked were: <b>Daily Mixes</b> - which were generated to match my preferences; <b>Artist Radios</b> - which were collections of music similar to selected artists; and <b>Specifically Selected</b> - which were songs I selected individually outside of any playlist. In addition to tracking the type of playlist, I also recorded how much attention I was giving to the music on a scale from 1 to 5, and how many songs I skipped.</p>

          <h2>The Explained Video Project</h2>
          <p>In my <em>Explained Video project</em>, my team explored possible breaches of ethics with regards to the use of <b>cryptocurrencies</b>. While there are some desirable attributes of <b>CC</b> use - such as an immutable record of transactions and confidentiality - they can be exploited for nefarious purposes. Many governments are in the process of deciding how they will regulate <b>CC</b>'s.</p>
